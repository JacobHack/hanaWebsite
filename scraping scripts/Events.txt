1945 German homosexual men were the last group to be released by the Allied forces from the Nazi camps
        Unlike other prisoners in German concentration camps during the Holocaust, the homosexual men who had survived the Holocaust experienced stigmatization and prejudice from even the Allied forces. Some Holocaust survivors were forced to carry out sentences in prison even after being released due to their violation of Paragraph 175.

1944 Homosexuality, Transvestism, and Psychosis Study of a Case Treated with Electroshock by Samuel Liebman is published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease
Overview: In this article, Sameul Liebman reviews a study where electroshock therapy was used to treat a patient who identified as a homosexual, and a transvestite. In the study, they found that as a result of electroshock therapy, the patient no longer identified as a transvestite, but still identified as a homosexual. Despite retaining his homosexuality, he now had restrained/inhibited sexual behavior compared to before the electroshock therapy. In the understanding of homosexuality in the 1940’s, the identity was accepted as a natural occurrence, but was something that could be fixed through medical intervention, it was treated similar to alcoholism. 
1947 Changing Concepts of Homosexuality in Psychoanalysis by Clara Thompson is published in Psychiatry
Overview: In this article, Clara Thompson works to identify 3 important parts of defining homosexuality: how it is used, how it is defined, and the social stigma surrounding the terminology. She relies on Freudian principles' impact on present psychoanalytic ideas about homosexuality. She argued that homosexuality is a symptom of neurotic structures and development, contrary to popular belief at the time that it was caused by neurosis. In this claim, she urges psychoanalysis experts to examine personality structure in order to better understand the causes of homosexuality, and therefore how to treat it.
1947 The Sex Habits of American Men: Some of the Findings of the Kinsey Report by Albert Deutsch is published in Harper’s Magazine
Overview: In December of 1947, Albert Deutsch published the journal article The Sex Habits of American Men: Some of the Finds of the Kinsey Report prior to Alfred Kinsey publishing Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. In his article, Deutsch works to assess the ways that the Kinsey report should prompt the public to change and develop the ways that sex and sexuality is viewed. He discusses the possibility of controversy that the release of the report will create in the societal context of the 1940’s. In his arguments, Deutsch presents the information from the Kinsey report using language and assertions that frame the report as absolute truth that should be pushing the public as a whole to accept developments in the ways that sex and sexuality are viewed.

1948 Alfred Kinsey’s Sexual Behavior in the Human Male is published
Date Published: January 1, 1948
Overview: Arguably the most famous published scientific work on homosexuality from the 1940’s, Alfred Kinsey’s Sexual Behavior in the Human Male presents a statistical study focused on creating a sense of the possible range of sexuality. The study, reliant upon interviews, is commonly criticized for its inconsistent samples as well as the unreliable nature of interviews. Throughout the study, Kinsey works to create a scale to determine the range of sexuality, eventually naming the measure: the Kinsey Scale. It organized the categories of sexual orientation from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. This report and the scale that it produced changed societal norms that reinforced the notion of strict binary categories previously used to define sexual orientation. It was particularly impactful due to the shock it caused in the public sphere in regards to the large percentage of males that had engaged in homosexuality (in some form or another at least once in their lives) reported in the study.

1950 A Senate report titled “Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government” is distributed to members of Congress
Overview: Strongly influenced by the Red Scare, the Lavender Scare came about out of social fear that was rapidly expanding due to governmental decision making. The Hoey committee, made up of a variety of individuals from medical professionals to law enforcement, created the Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government. This report was created in order to demonstrate the committee’s findings as well as propose recommendations based on their findings. One main finding that they presented was that around 5,000 individuals in the military and civilian workforce were found to be homosexual. They argued that homosexuals should not be employed within the U.S. government. The report used arguments surrounding the emotional instability and moral weakness of homosexuals and pointed to these attributes as main reasons that homosexuals were not to be trusted in governmental positions. It did not include any new policy proposals, but it did ask for harsher enforcement of current policy. This report would eventually lead to President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Executive Order 10450. This report is integral in understanding how social attitudes shape governmental decision making. It shows the way that existing prejudice can be easy to twist in times of great fear.

1953 Executive Order 10450 is signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower
An extension of the Red Scare, the Lavender Scare was a time period where the LGBT community was deemed a threat to national security. Executive Order 10450 was signed on April 27th of 1953 and essentially banned all homosexuals from working in the federal government. Around 7,000-10,000 federal employees were fired, or had resigned from their positions due to this Executive Order. This Executive Order was seen as an extension of Executive Order 9835 which established the first loyalty program in the federal government. Signed by President Harry S. Truman on March 21st of 1947, it was intended to remove communist influences from the federal government.

1953 Alfred Kinsey publishes Sexual Behavior in the Human Female 
Overview: As a continuation of his work in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), Alfred Kinsey et al. works to evaluate two behavioral characteristics: the frequency of sexual activity in women, and the ways in which women engage in sexual activity. In the study they looked at factors such as age, decade that the individual was born, and religious beliefs. Similar to their previous work, sampling bias and interview methodology made the study an easy target of criticism. 
1956 Evelyn Hooker presents her paper “The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual” at the APA Convention in Chicago
The APA in 1956 strongly believed that homosexuality was a mental illness. This was backed by studies and research done on individuals who were already experiencing mental illness in prisons and reform schools. Evelyn worked to expand on this work, researching gay men who had never been in therapy, and who had no track record with violating the law. She studied 30 gay men and 30 straight men as a control group. She had utilized a panel of experts who ran an identification test in a double-blind experiment where only Evelyn knew what participants were gay and what they were testing for. She found that the experts were unable to differentiate the gay men from the straight men. The main criticism that she faced at the APA convention was that her sample size had been insufficient. Based on her study, Evelyn argued that homosexuality was not pathological, and could not be classified as a mental illness.

1956 A Psychiatric Evaluation of Laws of Homosexuality by Karl Bowman and Bernice Engle is published in The American Journal of Psychiatry
Overview: In this article, Karl Bowman and Bernice Engle use phraseology in order to aid in understanding the feelings of prejudice and tradition that are associated with sodomy and other related acts. They focus on this more specifically in a legal setting. They argue that legal evaluation of the degree of guilt that is determined to be aligned with and assigned to each sex crime is commonly driven by emotion. They additionally argue that current laws on sex crimes leave opportunity for the targeting of specific individuals and groups. They argue that some laws amplify the danger of gossip, specifically pertaining to possible homosexuality of individuals when it puts an individual’s career and other things that make up a life at risk. Law has a significant role in shaping public opinion.
1958 The Kinsey Reports and the Legal Mind by Walter O. Weyrauch is published in the Florida Law Review
Overview: In this piece, Walter O. Weyrauch is interested in evaluating the thoughts of legally trained individuals on the Kinsey reports. He works with attorneys more specifically in an effort to contrast expert opinion with public reactions. He first identifies that public reactions were primarily negative and tended to be strongly associated with prejudice. He argues that legislative changes come from the reports’ influence on societal attitudes, and that attorneys should prepare themselves for these influences. He additionally prompts future attorneys to prepare themselves for these changes and influences by making themselves familiar with the research done in the Kinsey reports. He focuses on the symbiotic relationship between legal decision making and public opinion and predicts that both will be affected by the findings of the Kinsey reports.

1967 Reflections upon the Treatment of Sexual Disorders by the Behavioral Clinician: An Historical Comparison with the Treatment of the Alcoholic by Cyril M. Franks
Franks works to compare treatment of sexual deviation and alcoholism. He argues that “historically, the events of the past ten years may be compared to a similar evolution in the development of behavioral methods in the treatment of the alcoholic” (Franks 221). He anticipates that looking at previous patterns in behavioral treatment of sexual disorders, that the new developments that we will see will happen within a short window of time. I anticipate using this source to identify the ways in which the rapid evolution of the treatment of sexuality in medicine is not particularly unique or unpredictable, and even though it is shocking to see the rapid growth in between the 1990’s to now, especially legally, that it still follows a pattern that was predictable enough that Franks anticipated it in the 60’s.

Legal Sources
1972 Canterbury v. Spence
Overview: The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit evaluated whether or not a physician has a duty to disclose the risk associated with surgery. The Court held that a physician has a legal responsibility to disclose the potential risks of a medical procedure to a patient before allowing a patient to make an informed decision about whether to undergo treatment. This case outlined a right of an adult to make decisions regarding their body, the reasonable patient standard (a doctor has to disclose risks that a reasonable person in the patient’s scenario would consider to be important in making a decision regarding their medical care), and jury determination (jury gets to decide whether a doctor has provided sufficient information to the patient). 
Facts of the Case: Jerry W. Canterbury had gone in for a laminectomy to relieve pressure on his spinal cord that had been caused by a ruptured disk in his back. After the procedure he was paralyzed below the waist after being left alone in his hospital bed, leading to a fall from his hospital bed.  
Question: What is the standard for informed consent? 
Holding: Informed consent includes a patient’s right of self-decision. All risks that potentially affect medical decision making are deemed necessary. There are two exceptions: when a patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to consent (typically in emergent situations), and when disclosure of possible risk could be counterintuitive and from a medical standpoint would contradict and/or hinder possible treatment. 
Key Ideas and Information from this case:

1973 Roe v. Wade
Overview: The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not the Constitution recognizes a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. It held that the Right to Privacy is in the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment which would protect a pregnant woman’s choice whether or not to have an abortion.
Facts of the Case: Jane Roe (an alias used to protect the plaintiff’s identity), filed a lawsuit against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, Texas, challenging a Texas law that had made abortion illegal except to save a woman’s life. The case argued that the state law was unconstitutional due to its vague nature and its infringement of her personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. 
Question: Does the Constitution recognize a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion? What Amendment(s) protect this right?
Holding: The right to abortion is protected by the Constitution under the 9th and 14th Amendments, which protect the right to privacy
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Griswold v. Connecticut held that a state law banning contraception violated the right to privacy
* Girswold created a constitutional right to privacy and deemed that right fundamental
* It protected notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship
* Larger concept: right to privacy was board enough that it encompassed right to abortions
* Criminal abortion laws and 3 reasons to justify their continued existence: these laws were a product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct, when most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman, and finally, the State’s interest in protecting prenatal life (A woman’s determination is not absolute, right to privacy includes the abortion decision, Texas: apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy
* The State has an important and legitimate interest in the health of a mother
* Up until the end of the first trimester, physicians can make medical judgements in regards to abortion
* The state is free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens
* They don’t have a definite answer that the issue of abortion pertains specifically to the right of privacy concerns
* If privacy is no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions maybe a form of “liberty” protected by the 14th Amendment, they have ruled in favor of this on other cases
* Those who created the 14th Amendment did not intend for it to withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to abortions
* The Right to privacy is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy
* Right to privacy is in Due Process of the 14th Amendment
* Abortion right is fundamental
* Part of the public backlash included those who were morally upset and those who thought it was a public policy matter (legislators, not judges).
* Two types of restrictions pre-dominated: those that required consent of a woman’s parents or husband and those that limited government funding for abortion services
* Justice O’Connor argued that the trimester framework be abandoned and replaced with one that protects the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy

1973 Gay Coalition of Denver v. Denver
In October of 1973, the Gay Coalition of Denver (GCD) filed a civil lawsuit in an attempt to expand their civil rights and equality. During the case the GCD was able to access police records where they learned that 98% of those arrested for “offer of lewd conduct” were gay men. Through this case four laws that had previously pertained to loitering, cross-dressing, renting out rooms, and policies that enabled police entrapment through solicitation were repealed.

1972 At the American Psychiatric Association’s 125th Annual Meeting, John Fryer, better known as Dr. Anonymous gave a speech in favor of removing homosexuality from the DSM
Dr. Anonymous, an alias used for John Fryer, gave a speech at the APA’s annual meeting in 1972 where he revealed that he was a homosexual. He did so while wearing a disguise to protect his identity. He gave the speech with the intention of describing his experience as a homosexual in the psychiatric community. In his speech he urged his fellow psychiatrists who were homosexual like himself, to work to change the attitudes of those around them. Fryer explained the struggle of existing in the psychiatric community as a homosexual in relation to societal opinion and traditional values. He prompted the APA to remove the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness from the DSM. His speech would be a key factor in the APA’s decision to remove the classification in 1973.

1975 Homosexuality and the medical profession: a behaviorist’s view by John Bancroft is published in the Journal of Medical Ethics 
In this article, John Bancroft argued that homosexuality is not a disease, and does not make an individual a sinner. He identified that physicians have a key role in influencing society’s attitudes towards homosexuals and that with this in mind, doctors should treat these individuals with understanding. He comes to a few different conclusions. The first is that homosexuality is an interpersonal sexual relationship that is similar to heterosexuality, and should be treated as such. The second is that these individuals do seek professional help and should have that resource available to them if they are looking for it. The third is that some individuals need help from professionals to help with their sexual desires that may otherwise get them in trouble with the law. The fourth is that no matter what manner it is used, the law cannot replace or be used in tandem with medical treatment to “treat” homosexuality.

In 1981 the first cases of AIDS were recorded. In California and New York doctors had begun to see an influx of Kaposi’s Sarcoma in male patients. This article was the first of many that would stigmatize the correlation between gay men and AIDS. In early years of the AIDS crisis, with not much information on how the disease was transmitted it was thought that it was airborne and could be transferred from person to person.

1986 Bowers v. Hardwick
Overview: The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not there is a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy. The main argument that was presented was that you cannot do anything that you want in your home just because you want to (murder, etc.). There also was the question of if the government could ban sodomy and then pick out a specific group to enforce it upon. The Court held that there was no constitutional protection for acts of sodomy and that states could outlaw those practices. In this decision, the Court has acted to protect rights not easily identifiable in the constitution only when those rights are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, or when they are deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition (which the right to commit sodomy did not meet either standard).
Facts of the Case: Michael Hardwick was seen by a police officer while engaging in the act of consensual homosexual sodomy in the bedroom of his home. He was charged with violating a Georgia statute which criminalized sodomy. Hardwick challenged the constitutionality of the statute.
Question: Does the Constitution confer a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in consensual sodomy, thereby invalidating state laws that make such conduct illegal?
Holding: There is no constitutional protection for acts of sodomy.
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Framing of issue brings to question what standard it falls under, and how broad/narrow it is when addressing constitutional rights
* The narrow question they are tasked with answering is whether there is a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy
* They are concerned due to the fact that once a fundamental right is announced, it typically can’t be retracted
* You can’t do anything that you want in your home just because you want to (examples: murder, abuse, etc.)
* The case brings to light questions on whether or not the government can ban sodomy and then pick out a specific group to enforce it upon
* The Due Process Clause prevents the government from being able to ban something and then enforce it on a specific group since it deals with everyone, not specific groups
* The Court has acted to protect rights not easily identifiable in the Constitution only when those rights are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or when they are deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition
* The right to commit sodomy did not meet either standard
* The Justices expressed worries that guaranteeing a right to sodomy would be the product of judge-made constitutional law and would create an image of illegitimacy of the Court
* They found that there is no substantive right under the Due Process Clause
* Some Justices argued that liberty embraces the right to engage in non-reproductive sexual conduct

1984 Beyond “Homophobia”: Social Psychological Perspective on Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men by Gregory M. Herek is published in the Journal of Homosexuality
In this article, Gregory M. Herek works to define homophobia as hostile reactions derived from fear. Based on this definition of homophobia, he argues for the development of knowledge about the overall psychology surrounding both positive and negative attitudes towards homosexual individuals. He argues that there are three ways to differentiate attitudes towards homosexual individuals: experiential (allowing past experience to affect current attitudes), defensive (allowing one’s inner fear and anxiety to be taken out on homosexual individuals), and symbolic (having views that are closely tied to a concept of self and one’s social network). He additionally works to find any differences between attitudes toward gay men and lesbians.
1985 Homophobia Among Physicians and Nurses: An Empirical Study is published by Carolyn J. Douglas et al. in Psychiatric Services
In this article, Carolyn J. Douglas et al. looked at attitudes towards homosexuality in medical practitioners at an urban teaching hospital. They found that respondents who were female were significantly more homophobic than their male counterparts. Additionally, they found that those who had a friend or family member who was part of the LGBT community were less homophobic than those who did not. Close to 10% of the respondents in the study agreed with a provided statement that “homosexuals who contract AIDS are getting what they deserve” (Douglas et al. 1309). Douglas et al. claims that based on these findings, there should be a response from the medical community and that homophobia is higher than otherwise would have been expected in the tested group of health professionals. 
1985 AIDS and the Gay Community: Between the Specter and the Promise of Medicine is published by Ronald Bayer in Social Research
Ronald Bayer works to evaluate the promises that have been made by the medical community and the government in respect to developments and protection. The AIDS crisis is something that he identifies as being a point of extreme tension between the public and medical health professionals. The AIDS crisis and the CDC’s (and health officials as a whole) reaction to the crisis have emphasized the fears of the public, specifically LGBT patients. He argues that this fear stems from existing hope that the healthcare system and medicine overall will be able to come up with solutions that they had previously made promises of.
1986 A report was issued by the U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on AIDS

In this piece, Gary Remafedi conducted a study on 29 homosexual and bisexual teenagers. They interviewed the participants looking at possible impacts of family, employment, education, relationships, and both physical and mental health on sexuality. They found that a majority of those interviewed had experienced problems at school, and had a history of STDs, running away from home, or conflict with the law. A minority of those interviewed had been sexually assaulted or been involved in prostitution. In the study, those that were younger than 18 years old had higher rates of psychiatric hospitalization, substance abuse, being high school dropouts, and had more conflict with the law than their older counterparts. 
1987 Medicine and Law: AIDS, Constitutional Challenges to Tort Reform and Medical Malpractice is published by David Randolph Smith in the Tort & Insurance Law Journal
In this source, David Randolph Smith looks to examine 3 issues that have become of interest to those in the field of law and medicine. He evaluates: (1) “significant and developing legal issues related to AIDS in the areas of discrimination, criminal law, tort liability and insurance,” (2) “the constitutionality of recent tort reform laws, particularly under emerging principles of state constitutional law,” and (3) “medical malpractice liability with a focus on trends in the law of informed consent, emotional distress and hospital liability for premature transfer of uninsured patients” (Smith 370). The piece is informative, but in his timeline he reinforces the concept that the law is continuously evolving in relation to LGBT issues and that the AIDS crisis is a particularly special example of a time period in the 80’s where legal reform reacted to social and medical issues.
1988 The CDC mails a brochure (Understanding AIDS) to every household in the U.S.

Influenced by the AIDS epidemic, and curious about how attitudes towards homosexuality on a social, political, and economic scale function and interact with one another, Irving Bieber works to understand attitudes towards sexuality over time. He works to evaluate famous individuals such as Freud, as well as events leading up to and including the AIDS crisis. He is specifically looking at a 25 year span of time from 1963-1988 where he stands in history. This time period works with social events such as the Stonewall riots, and Dr. Anonymous’s speech at the APA conference in 1973. This time period is particularly salient and significant when looking at changes in our understanding and attitudes towards homosexuality.

1997 Homosexuality in Cold War America: Resistance and the Crisis of Masculinity by Robert J. Corber is published
In this book, Robert J. Corber works to evaluate changes in societal attitudes in the gay community towards “coming out” in the 1950’s. He specifically observes how gay men fought back against societal pressure to remain closeted. He uses sources from the time such as novels, plays, and films to better understand attitudes, while also evaluating the national security state, the growth of the suburbs, and postwar consumer culture to better understand organization and political reform coming out of this period. Corber additionally identifies gay male writers from the period such as Tennessee Williams who worked contradictory to the gay community as a whole, declining to represent homosexuality as a subculture, and instead emboldening this experience as a shared experience of oppression.

1996 Romer v. Evans
Overview: The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not Amendment 2 of Colorado’s State Constitution (which forbade the extension of official protections to those who suffer discrimination due to their sexual orientation) violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. It held that Amendment 2 of the Colorado State Constitution violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was not rationally related to its stated purpose. The Amendment had singled out homosexual and bisexual individuals, which had denied them the right to seek and receive specific legal protection from discrimination. The dissent had argued that the majority decision is not Constitutionally grounded and that the Colorado provision did not disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but instead denied them preferential treatment.
Facts of the Case: Colorado voted to add Amendment 2 to the Colorado State Constitution. This Amendment would preclude any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. 
Question: Does Amendment 2 of Colorado’s State Constitution, forbidding the extension of official protections to those who suffer discrimination due to their sexual orientation, violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause?
Holding: Amendment 2 of the Colorado State Constitution does violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Strict scrutiny was used on this case
* Amendment 2 of the Colorado State Constitution violated the Equal Protection Clause
* Amendment 2 singled out homosexual and bisexual persons, imposing on them a broad disability by denying them the right to seek and receive specific legal protection from discrimination
* Amendment 2, by depriving persons of equal protection under the law due to their sexual orientation failed to advance a legitimate interest
* The dissent argued that the majority decision was not constitutionally grounded and that the Colorado provision does it disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but denies them preferential treatment
* The amendment violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was not rationally related to its stated purpose

1999 Baker v. Vermont
Facts of the Case: Advocates for same-sex marriage filed a lawsuit against Vermont on the basis of the State’s history in regards to establishing rights for gays and lesbians.
Question: Whether or not a Vermont law that prohibits same-sex couples from receiving the same benefits and protections that married opposite-sex couples received violated the Vermont Constitution.
Holding: The State is constitutionally required to extend to same-sex couples the same benefits and protections that flow from marriage under Vermont State law. 
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Vermont State law claims that marriage as written into the law, was meant to be between a man and a woman
* Plaintiffs claim that marriage law is supposed to protect and encourage the union of committed couples
* States claim that a long history of official intolerance to same-sex marriage and relationships does not support a finding of constitutional protection is unfounded
* The court found the law to be in violation of the Vermont constitution, but it did not find that marriage licenses for same-sex couples were required
* There were two main ideas proposed: statutory claim that they should be allowed to get married (which is rejected), and a constitutional claim using the rational basis test, that not allowing couples that want to be married will indirectly negatively affect children that those couples may have

1990 Doctor’s attitudes to male homosexuality: A survey is published by Dinesh Bhugra et al. in Sexual and Marital Therapy 
In this piece, Dinesh Bhugra et al. works to evaluate the attitudes of psychiatrists and general practitioners towards the LGBT community. What is particular about this study is that it focuses on male homosexual patients rather than female homosexual patients since they claim that they attract more attention and more feelings are demonstrated towards the male population. The limitations of this study are that the sample size was small enough that it cannot be used to create assumptions about the population of psychiatrists and general practitioners as a whole. It also does not work to differentiate the difference between those who had already been trained and were practicing, and those who were still in training. Additionally, the more extreme responses were dulled down in the statistical analysis format.
1991 Gladstone launches the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology (GIVI) to address the rising HIV/AIDS crisis
The Gladstone Institute created the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology (GIVI) to help to better understand the AIDS Crisis. The program would later work on heading the global iPrEx study that helped to gain FDA approval for Truvada and PrEP. 
1994 Emotional, behavioral, and HIV risks associated with sexual abuse among adult homosexual and bisexual men is published by Bradford N. Bartholow et al. in Child Abuse & Neglect
In this article, Bradford N. Bartholow et al. evaluated data collected from urban STD clinics from May of 1989 through April of 1990. 1,001 men who were homosexual and bisexual were interviewed to determine the correlation between sexual abuse in adolescence “mental health counseling and hospitalization, psychoactive substance use, depression, suicidal thoughts or actions, social support, sexual identity development, HIV risk behavior…and risk of sexually trasmitted diseases including HIV infection” (Bartholow et al., 745). They found that the data demonstrates a relation between sexual abuse, quality of life, and health risk behavior in homosexual men. They argue that “increased awareness as to the potential outcomes of male sexual abuse is critically important to the design and implementation of medical and psychological services for sexually abused men” (Bartholow et al., 745). The health risks associated with being homosexual can be both physically and mentally damaging and thus better treatment from healthcare providers is necessary. 
1996 Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) is in early development 
HAART works to prevent the HIV virus from multiplying and therefore damaging the immune system. It significantly reduced mortality rates that were associated with HIV/AIDS. It includes protease inhibitors, NRTIs, and other classes of antiretroviral drugs. 
1997 Trends: Attitudes Toward Homosexuality by Alan S. Yang is published in The Public Opinion Quarterly
In this piece, Alan S. Yang first acknowledges that public sentiment towards homosexuality in society has changed drastically in the two decades leading up to the 90’s. This rate of change has not yet been mapped and it has not been seen before in history. He uses 12 issue areas to create a survey to determine public opinion using empirical evidence. The issue areas include the legality of homosexual behavior and the causes of homosexuality. 
1997 AIDS and the New Medical Gaze: Bio-Politics, AIDS, and Homosexuality by Dion Dennis is published in the Journal of Homosexuality
In this article, Dion Dennis works to evaluate the ways in which identity-politics has affected the re-medicalization of homosexuals in the 1980’s. He argues that the re-medicalization of homosexuality as well as a reemergence of homophobia in the public sphere is tied to a quarter century of identity politics. He finds that deconstructing and freeing the public from the bio-bureaucratic categories that has created this movement in the 80’s in reaction to the AIDS crisis is something that creates a necessary intervention from the public. He argues that not only the LGBT population, but the population as a whole has to react for something to happen.
1997 A Review of the Medical Consequences of Homophobia with Suggestions for Resolution by Katherine A. O’Hanlan et al. is published in the Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association
Katherine A. O’Hanlan et al. conducted a wide overview focusing on the societal, psychosocial, and medical consequences of homophobia. In order to understand this, they looked at a variety of sources including peer-reviewed articles, non-peer-reviewed articles, census data, survey reports (unpublished and published), and current newspaper coverage of events. The researchers conclude that regardless of sexual orientation, or political/religious affiliation, physicians should still be required to be held to their duty to provide the highest standard of care to all patients, regardless of individual differences. They acknowledge the power that physicians in particular have in effecting the treatment of particular populations, and urge that physicians not only use their power to create positive outcomes on an individual basis, but also to support legislation that can help to create more accessibility and expand care for the LGBT community. 
1997 HAART can now be taken as a single daily tablet, making it easier for people living with HIV to take their medication
Initially, when HAART was used as the standard of care for those with HIV, the patient would have to take multiple pills a day. In 1997, the FDA approved Combivir that combined two HIV drugs and made treatment easier. 
1998 Attitudes of physicians practicing in New Mexico toward gay men and lesbians in the profession by Mary M. Ramos et al. is published in Academic Medicine
In this article, Mary M. Ramos et al. works to evaluate the attitudes of physicians, specifically in New Mexico. In contrast to other studies, Ramos et al. works to look at attitudes towards LGBT medical students, house officers, and physician colleagues. They found that physician attitudes towards LGBT medical students, house officers, and physician colleagues have improved considerably in comparison to similar studies that were conducted in earlier years. Despite this, the LGBT community still is facing prejudice.
1998 AIDS and the discursive construction of homosexuality by Steven Seidman is published in The New American Cultural Sociology
In this piece, Steven Seidman works to track historical movements in the western world (such as the various women's movements) in the 1980’s that shifted sexual conventions and prejudices and how this would lead to different reactions to the AIDS crisis. He additionally looked at movements from groups that he deemed to be more sexually disenfranchised such as the elderly and disabled populations. He pays special attention to changes in traditionally held values and how this impacts reactions to the AIDS crisis. He argues that it is important to track these changes in sexual norms and behavior during the 1980’s to track how it impacted the AIDS crisis.
1998 Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey Report: Historical Overview and Lasting Contributions by Vern L. Bullough is published in The Journal of Sex Research
In this article, Vern L. Bullough argues that the work of Alfred Kinsey was the major factor that changed attitudes surrounding sex and sexuality in the twentieth century. He traces 1890-1940 as a precursor to Kinsey’s work, specifically focusing on the history of sex research. He then describes Kinsey’s major contributions which included challenging prejudice and preconceived notions relating to sex and sexuality, at least in the United States.

2003 Lawrence v. Texas
Overview: The Supreme Court evaluated whether the criminal convictions of John Lawrence and Tyron Garner under the Texas “Homosexual Conduct” law (which criminalized sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples) violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection in regards to laws. The main argument was focused on if criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violated their vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. They held that the Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct violates the Due Process Clause. They found that the Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. It overruled Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186. They held that stare decisis (the belief that courts and judges should uphold precedent) doesn’t make Bowers precedent because of some assumptions such as the belief that contemporary morals and tradition condemn homosexual sodomy are no longer reliable.
Facts of the Case: The Supreme Court evaluated whether the criminal convictions of John Lawrence and Tyron Garner under the Texas “Homosexual Conduct” law (which criminalized sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples) violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection in regards to laws. 
Question: Do criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violate vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment?
Holding: They held that the Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct violates the Due Process Clause. They found that the Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. It overruled Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186. They held that stare decisis (the belief that courts and judges should uphold precedent) doesn’t make Bowers precedent because of some assumptions such as the belief that contemporary morals and tradition condemn homosexual sodomy are no longer reliable.
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Decided on the basis of whether Lawrence and Garner were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause
* The Texas statute furthers no legitimate State interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual
* This case overruled Bowers v. Hardwick
* Texas law was found to be an unjustified violation of privacy and liberty rights and Texas cannot justify abridging these rights
* Stare decisis doesn’t make Bowers precedent because of some assumptions such as the belief that contemporary morals and tradition condemn homosexual sodomy are no longer reliable
* Texas law singles out one group (homosexual men) and denies them the equal protection of the law due to their disadvantaged status without any legitimate legislative purpose
* Scalia points out that the same rationale used to decide to overturn Bowers could have been used to overturn Roe v. Wade in Casey
* Scalia additionally argues that in this decision the Court had blatantly taken a side based on morals that interrupt the Court’s role as a neutral observer
2003 Goodridge v. Department of Public Health
Overview: The Massachusetts Supreme Court evaluated whether or not denying same-sex couples the right to marry violated the individual liberty and equality safeguards of the Massachusetts Constitution. The court held that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated the state Constitution which guaranteed individual liberty and equality, and that it was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. This made Massachusetts the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States.
Facts of the Case: GLAD (Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders) sued the Massachusetts Department of Health in Superior Court in place of 7 different same-sex couples who had been denied marriage licenses in March and April of 2001. 
Question: Is denying same-sex couples the right to marry in violation of individual liberty and equality safeguards of the Massachusetts Constitution, protecting freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into protected areas of life and freedom to partake in State benefits.
Holding: The court held that excluding same-sex couples from rights to marriage was unconstitutional.
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* The court could not deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry
* The marriage ban did not meet the rational basis test for either Due Process or Equal Protection 
* Marriage is identified as a legal/institutional structure
* Marriage is a stability maker in history
* It has two parts: a statutory claim that they should be allowed to get married (which is rejected), and a constitutional claim that the law that prohibited same-sex couples from freedom from government intrusion into protected areas of life and freedom to partake in state benefits
* Desire/the choice to get married matters over whether heterosexual or homosexual couples should be able to get married
* The State has an interest in procreation, two heterosexual people raising children, and allocation of scarce resources (conceded that same-sex parents could be great parents)
* Foster care systems in the system at this time allowed same-sex couples to foster children
* Enforcing same-sex marriage would show care for people in general
* The ending remarks include the argument that marriage has survived multiple transformations and it will be able to survive this transformation
2004 HIV: Fear of AIDS or Medical Malpractice by Richard J. Hunter Jr is published in the North Dakota Law Review (NDL Rev)
        In this piece, Richard J. Hunter Jr traces legal cases such as Doe v. Arts (2003) and the history of AIDS to better understand the implications of medical malpractice suits that are affecting LGBT patients. He more specifically evaluated a specific case that evaluated if “a doctor who misreads an HIV test, telling a patient that it is positive, be held liable for emotional damages caused by the misdiagnosis and subsequent advice” (Hunter 386). Another case he looks at is Williamson v. Waldman (2003).

2001 Original Research: Confronting the Culture of Medicine: Gay Men’s Experiences with Primary Care Physicians by Gregory P. Beehler is published in the Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association
        In this article, Gregory P. Beehler works to evaluate the perspective of homosexual men on primary health care. They found that gay men tend to experience health care at two different levels: macro (all medicine is homophobic and is functioning on prejudice which affects treatment), and micro (on an individual level where more of a connection is formed for more of a physician-patient relationship that leads to more trust). They argued that in the current climate of the healthcare system, gay men are required to grapple with prejudice and traditional values that makes it harder for them to receive appropriate care. They acknowledge that appropriate care and meaningful and stable relationships can be formed with health care professionals, but that it is not a given thing like it is for heterosexual patients.
2001 Original Research: Does “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” Apply to Health Care? Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual People’s Disclosure to Health Care Providers by Michele J. Eliason and Robert Schope is published in the Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association
        In this source, Michele J. Eliason and Robert Schope work to evaluate factors that contribute to and inversely hinder disclosure, as well as the protective strategies that can be found in healthcare settings. They argue that the rates of disclosure stay as low as they are due to fear of providers. 
2001 Homosexuality and Psychoanalysis by Tim Dean and Christopher Lane is published
Similar to Bieber (1988) and Roughton (2002), Dean and Lee work to understand how Freud’s more accepting view of homosexuality as a natural part of human behavior can shape our views on homosexuality going forward. They specifically look at attitudes stemming from the psychoanalysis community and how their negative views towards homosexuality have changed over time. The piece is in the format of a collection of essays, making it easier to read for high school students. The experts they have written in the book work with texts from Freud, Klein, Reich, Lacan, and Laplanche. They use these previous evaluations to better understand attitudes on psychosis, homophobia, AIDS, and more individual/clinical knowledge on pleasure, disgust, etc.

2002 Rethinking Homosexuality: What It Teaches Us About Psychoanalysis by Ralph E. Roughton is published in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association
In this article, Roughton splits up his work into 3 distinct sections: “(1) the process of policy change and the overturning of injustice; (2) the excursion after Freud’s death into analytic bias and extreme pathologizing of homosexuality, the struggle to overcome those distortions, and the lessons to be learned from this history; and (3) the search, in the coming decade, for new understanding of homosexuality and all aspects of sexuality” (Roughton 733). He particularly hones in on the importance of Freud’s concepts and the ability to expand these concepts to be more inclusive and accessible to different populations.
2003 The Medical Abnormality of Homosexuality by Michael Brendan Flanagan is published in The Linacre Quarterly
In this piece, Michael Brendan Flanagan works to look at the pathology of homosexual behavior, and considers what makes it a danger to public health. He argues that the movement towards “political correctness” has created a push for accepting homosexuality in the medical community, where it is otherwise evident that “the homosexual act of union, anal copulation, is a dirty, unsanitary act which contravenes basic rules of hygiene. Its abnormality is self-evident” (Flanagan 232-233). He looks at semen antibodies, sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men, gay bowel syndrome, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and pedophilia and related conditions.
2003 The same but different: clinician-patient communication with gay and lesbian patients by Kathleen A. Bonvicini and Michael J. Perlin is published in Patient Education and Counseling
In this article, Kathleen A. Bonvicini and Michael J. Perlin work to create a summary of medical literature that pertains to healthcare with gay and lesbian patients. They work to evaluate common communication barriers. They argue that there are a ton of different strategies that can be applied to create more inclusion and better treatment for lesbian and gay patients in healthcare (as patients). They argue that their proposed strategies will create more effective communication between patients and medical professionals. Some of these strategies include: structuring questions to questions that are aimed towards gaining knowledge of a patient’s sexual orientation and relationship status, as well as to create a safe and welcoming practice environment, and finally to communicate consideration of partners and family relationships.
2004 Treatment Counselor’s Attitudes About Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Clients: Urban vs. Rural Settings by Michele J. Eliason and Tonda Hughes is published in Substance Use and Misuse
In this piece, Michele J. Eliason and Tonda Hughes focus on treatment counselor attitudes in particular. They look at the attitudes of treatment counselors towards LGBT individuals as well as how these attitudes can affect a client’s recovery. They are interested in how differences in locations (and therefore training and ability) changes these attitudes and affects, and if a difference between the two even exists at all. They used urban Chicago and rural Iowa in 2000 as the population samples. They found that Chicago’s counselors were more racially diverse, and more likely to have grown up in an urban setting than the Iowa counselors. This meant that they reported having more contact with the LGBT population. Despite this, they did not have more knowledge or a more positive association with the LGBT population. Both populations were found to have not sufficient knowledge in the area of the LGBT community including legal issues, domestic partnership, internalized homophobia, etc. Nearly half of the counselors, regardless of urban or rural location reported negative or ambivalent attitudes toward the LGBT population
2004 Psychoanalytic attitudes towards homosexuality: An empirical research by Vittorio Lingiardi and Paola Capozzi is published in The International Journal of Psychoanalysis
In this article, Vittorio Lingiardi and Paola Capozzi conduct an analysis of existing psychoanalytic theories on homosexuality, focusing on attitudes towards homosexuality. They conducted this study on the Italian community so it is not particularly applicable to studying the United States, but it is helpful in understanding that these attitudes are not only identifiable in the U.S. and therefore is not a direct reflection of the health care system in the United States. They used a questionnaire as their way of obtaining results. Their pool was only 206 respondents (out of the 600 individuals that they sent the questionnaire to). 
2006 Medical Students’ Ability to Care for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Patients by Nelson F. Sanchez et al. is published in Family Medicine-Kansas City
In this article, Nelson F. Sanchez et al. works to look at the relationship between medical students and the LGBT patients that they are treating. They looked at this relationship in particular in order to “identify potential deficiencies in medical school curricula pertaining to this care” (Sanchez et al., 21). Through their study, they found that “medical students with increased clinical exposure to LGBT patients tended to perform more comprehensive histories, hold more positive attitudes toward LGBT patients, and possess greater knowledge of LGBT health care concerns than students with little or no clinical exposure” (Sanchez et al., 21).
2007 Their Lack of Masculine Security and Aggression Was Obvious by Stephen Patnode was published in the Canadian Bulletin of Medical History
In this article, Stephen Patnode works to evaluate the role of gender and sexuality from the 30’s to the 50’s in U.S. history. This article helps us to understand earlier events that shaped attitudes towards homosexuality in the medical community. He identifies Prohibition as a period of time in which psychiatrists who were focusing on treating addiction identified homosexuality as a possible connector (side effect maybe) of alcoholism. This helps us to understand the treatment of those who were members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in relation to how homosexuals were treated in this period by medical professionals.
2007 Substance Abuse Treatment Providers’ Explicit and Implicit Attitudes Regarding Sexual Minorities by Bryan N. Cochran et al. is published in the Journal of Homosexuality
In this piece, Bryan N. Cochran et al. works to investigate treatment providers’ attitudes toward LGBT individuals. They worked with a sample of 46 substance abuse treatment counselors. They found that the counselors who were heterosexual and who had less LGBT friends tended to have more negative biases regarding LGBT individuals. It is notable that biases in this sample were significantly less than in comparison samples. The general argument of this study is similar to the other studies that I will be looking at in the fact that it is looking to prove that current treatment for the LGBT community is not sufficient and therefore should be expanded. The study acknowledges that their findings may be limited due to the substantial proportion of participants who identify themselves as LGBT and who may have more of an interest in LGBT treatment than other counselors may.
2007 Review of Empirical Research Focused on the Experience of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients in Counseling and Psychotherapy by Kathleen J. Bieschke et al. is published in the 
Handbook of Counseling and Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Clients
In this article, Kathleen J. Bieschke et al. works to conduct a literature review on what other scholars have found in relation to counseling and psychotherapy for LGBT clients. They found that LGBT clients participate in therapy more frequently than heterosexual clients, and that even when therapists claim to be affirmative in their care, they are found to have heterosexual bias that affects their care. This work was done to build on previous literature reviews done, working to expand to therapist attitudes towards LGBT clients as well as expanding their view to conversion therapy.
2007 The Negative Health Effects of Homosexuality by Timothy J. Dailey is published in Family Research Council
In this article, Timothy J. Dailey identifies that Hollywood and the media have been working to bring political and social equality through the use of portraying homosexual individuals as being the same as heterosexual individuals. He finds this to be harmful since the two groups aren’t the same, and medically should not be treated as such. Acknowledging that homosexuality makes you more prone to certain diseases, more specifically STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) makes treatment for the LGBT community more accessible. He argues that gay men and lesbians who are engaging in sexual relationships are more at risk for: risky sexual behavior, promiscuity, HPV (Human Papillomavirus), hepatitis, gonorrhea, syphilis, gay bowel syndrome, HIV/AIDS, anal cancer, intimate partner violence, greater risk of suicide, and possible reduced life span. All of these risks are life-threatening and Dailey argues that they need to be treated as such. This piece does not have any clear bias, but is clearly fighting against biases being propagated through the media.
2009 Psychoanalysis and Male Homosexuality by Kenneth Lewes comes out
In this book, Kenneth Lewes evaluates how male homosexuality has been viewed in the context of historical, cultural, and theoretical works. He works through ideas of homosexuality stemming from Freud to the 1980’s. He demonstrates the ways that compassion and understanding became less important to psychoanalytic clinicians and theorists. He focuses specifically on the limits and opportunities that come with psychoanalysis.

2015 Obergefell v. Hodges
Overview: The Supreme Court evaluated two questions. The first concerned whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment required a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex. The second concerned whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment required a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex that was legally licensed and performed in another state. The Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the right to marry for same sex couples as one of the fundamental liberties. They additionally found that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed the right for same sex couples to marry since they have equal protection under the law. 
Facts of the Case: In Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee groups represented same-sex couples and challenged the constitutionality of each state’s bans on same-sex marriage or refusal to recognize same-sex marriages that happened outside of the original state. They each argued that the states’ statutes violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendments. One group additionally argued that it violated the Civil Rights Act. 
Question: Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex? Does the Fourteenth Amendment required a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex that was legally licensed and performed in another state?
Holding: The Court held that the Due Process Clause guarantees the right to marry as one of the fundamental liberties it protects. The Equal Protection Clause additionally guarantees the right of same-sex couples to marry as the denial of that right would deny same-sex couples equal protection under the law.
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Ohio at the time only recognized marriage between one man and one woman
* The State banned same-sex marriages and would not recognize same-sex marriages that were performed in states where it was legal
* The main couple argued that the states marriage bans violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses in the 14th Amendment
* The district court ruled in their favor and additionally ruled that the bans discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and that the State failed to justify it under heightened Equal Protection scrutiny or rational basis review
* The U.S. Court of Appeals for the sixth circuit reversed the decision by applying a deferential rational basis test
* They argued in the Supreme Court that Ohio’s bans violate the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of Due Process
* Identified that classifications on the basis of sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny since gays and lesbians are a vulnerable group, and even under rational basis scrutiny the bans can’t survive
* Hodges argued that nationalizing domestic relations would erode the federalist structure, there is no prejudice coming from the state, and democracy-enhancing rational basis review applies
* Ruled that the 14th Amendment requires all states to license marriages between same-sex couples and to recognize all marriages that were lawfully performed out of state
* The dissent argued that while same-sex marriage may be a good policy, the Constitution doesn’t address it so it should not be up to the Court to decide
* The dissent additionally argued that by allowing a majority of the Court to decide a new right, the majority opinion strayed from the democratic process and expanded the power of the judiciary beyond what the Constitution allows
* If marriage is an institution, that promotes stability and not allowing same-sex marriage negatively affects raising kids
* The language in the decision included using “person” instead of “citizen”
* Four reasons that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right: inherent in the concept of individual autonomy, supports 2-person union unlike any other, safeguards children and families, and marriage is a keystone of social order
* The Due Process Clause does not allow for a change in the original definition of marriage
* The dissent argued that there are restrictions on marriage (can’t marry family, children can’t marry, etc.) and restriction same-sex marriage falls under the same logic

2010 Queer Diagnoses: Parallels and Contrasts in the History of Homosexuality, Gender Variance, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual by Jack Drescher is published in Archives of Sexual Behavior
In this article, Jack Drescher works to evaluate changes in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) over time, starting in 1973. He specifically evaluates how homosexuality as a diagnosis was removed from the DSM-II in 1973 as well as how the GID (Gender Identity Disorder) diagnosis came to be in the DSM-III in 1980. His work is scientific but mimics a historiographical format. He evaluates the past of the DSM in order to recommend future changes for the DSM-V, as well as argues that the APA (American Psychiatric Association) and the DSM have a distinct role in changing and shifting societal attitudes towards the LGBT community. 
2011 The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) publishes its landmark report on health disparities among LGBT individuals and its recommendations to address these disparities
The report is released to promote an expansion in knowledge in the research being done on LGBT health and the disparities in treatment of the community. 
2012 The FDA approves Truvada as HIV prep
On July 16, 2012 the FDA approved Truvada which would reduce HIV-1 infection in adults who are considered to be high risk. 
2012 Discourse/Discours - An Integrative Review of Nurse Attitudes Towards Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Patients by Caroline Dorsen is published in the Canadian Journal of Nursing Research
In this article, Caroline Dorsen works to evaluate the negative impacts of healthcare worker attitudes on the health of LGBT patients through an intensive literature review. She argues that increased knowledge of this can lead to more resources being put towards fixing these attitudes through awareness and training. She focuses more specifically on nurse attitudes towards LGBT patients. She points out that the majority of the studies being looked at are more than a decade old and that they often demonstrate sampling and response biases. This piece is unique since it pertains specifically to nurse attitudes rather than physicians or other healthcare professionals.
2013 Gladstone launches the series “Out in Science” which showcases the lives and careers of LGBTQ scientists
2013 The APA updates the DSM-V to replace the heavily stigmatized term “gender identity disorder” with “gender dysphoria” to classify transgender individuals
This replacement was done with the intention of reducing stigma and redirecting care to focus on distress experienced by some in the transgender community. It emphasized the distress that transgender individuals experience that may lead them to look for treatment either for mental health, physical health, or for both.
2014 The Influence of Declining Homophobia on Men’s Gender in the United States: An Argument for the study of Homohysteria by Mark McCormack and Eric Anderson is published in Sex Roles
In this article, Mark McCormack and Eric Anderson focus on “the impact of decreasing homophobia on socially acceptable gendered behaviors among heterosexual males in the U.S.” (McCormack and Anderson 109). Their work is helpful in understanding greater societal attitudes towards homosexual men (that inherently impact the attitudes of medical professionals). It isn't particularly salient in understanding healthcare outcomes, but it is helpful in understanding the changing attitudes in heterosexual males, and how the inclusion of homosexual males into traditionally heterosexual spaces is impacting the groups and how they interact. 
2014 Provider beliefs and practices about assessing sexual orientation in two veterans health affairs hospitals by Michele D. Sherman et al. is published in LGBT Health 
In this piece, Michele D. Sherman et al. evaluates the intersectionality between the LGBT community, the veteran community, and healthcare providers. They work to argue that staff training is a necessary development to improve treatment for veterans who are in the LGBT community. This work is different from my other sources since it includes a whole community that includes the LGBT community as a subsector, rather than the main focus of treatment. One big limitation to this source is that even though half of the participants worked in mental health in the other professions only 19% were physicians, 16% were psychologists, and 15% were social workers. The goal of this source is to both expand and improve patient care for veterans who are also a part of the LGBT community. 
2014 When Homosexuality Came Out (of the DSM) by Vivek Datta is published in Mad in America: Science, Psychiatry and Social Justice 
In this article, Vivek Datta argues that tracking the history of homosexuality in the DSM can show us that changes in disorders takes time, that diagnoses are strongly tied to and influenced by social prejudice, that the idea of illnesses and disorders is a social construct, the way we choose to define disorders has direct social consequences, and that shifts in our overall perceptions of the nature of disorders helps us to better understand social, political, and economic factors better than it helps us understand scientific advancement.
2015 Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality by Jack Drescher is published in Behavioral Sciences
In this article, Jack Drescher focuses on the history of homosexuality as a diagnosis in the DSM (Dianostic and Statistical Manual) tracking its conception in DSM-I to its removal from DSM III. He then looks at the sociocultural aftermath of the 1973 removal of homosexuality as a diagnosis from the DSM. He identifies three categories in which homosexuality falls into: pathology, immaturity, and normal variation. He describes theories of pathology as portraying homosexuality as a sign of a defect, and associate it with being morally bad, and a social evil. He describes theories of immaturity as representing homosexuality as a normal, and natural given step towards the development of heterosexuality which comes when one becomes an adult. Lastly, he addresses the theory of normal variation in which homosexuality is treated as a natural occurrence (like being left handed). Drescher argues that the APA’s revision of the DSM after 1973 was the start of shifts in the national and international health communities as well as the start of a shift away from debates about medicine and psychiatry and redirected towards moral and political conversations. He additionally argues that removing the diagnosis from the DSM moved conversations from being about what causes and what can treat homosexuality and towards the health needs of the LGBT patients themselves.
2015 Health care Provider’s Implicit and Explicit Attitudes Toward Lesbian Women and Gay Men by Janice A. Sabin et al. is published in the American Journal of Public Health 
In this piece, Janice A. Sabin et al. works to look at the implicit and explicit attitudes of healthcare providers towards LGBT individuals. They found that implicit preferences favored heterosexual individuals over those who were LGBT. They found that more specifically, heterosexual nurses had the strongest implicit preference for heterosexual men over gay men. In all groups of the study, explicit preferences were weaker than implicit preferences. They argue that implicit preferences for heterosexual individuals over those in the LGBT community within the heterosexual health care provider population are strong and affect care. They propose that future research needs to focus on how this implicit sexual prejudice affects care.
2016 Homosexuality: A Review on the Health Effects by Peace Eze et al. is published in the Journal of Biology and Medicine
Similar to Daily (2007), Peace Eze et al. works to point out that equity over equality is a better approach, at least from a health and medical treatment standpoint. In this piece, Eze et al. argues that pushing a narrative that homosexual individuals are just as healthy as heterosexual ones ignores parts of the homosexual identity, and that ignoring aspects of the health challenges that come with being a homosexual individual can put a patient’s care at risk. They emphasize that discrimination is not the solution, but that in order to fairly treat the LGBT community, the health risks associated with the differences in their behaviors and cultural practices within the community should be taken into consideration in treatment.

2016 Associations between non-discrimination and training policies and physicians' attitudes and knowledge about sexual and gender minority patients: a comparison of physicians from two hospitals by Jennifer M. Jabson et al. is published in BMC Public Health
In this article, Jennifer M. Jabson et al. works to look at how training, policies, and non-discrimination policies correlates to the attitudes of physicians as well as their overall knowledge of LGBT patients. This study had a low response rate, making the sample size small enough that it makes it hard to generalize. Though, this low response rate arguably can be used to demonstrate physician attitudes toward LGBT patients since it reflects physician disregard for and lack of awareness of LGBT patient care issues. They additionally are looking at the effectiveness of the HEI (Healthcare Equality Index) and find that even with implementation, it may not create the positive change that the HEI intended (to improve healthcare treatment for LGBT patients). They acknowledge that physician attitudes are typically a reflection of their socio political environments.
2017 Who has the worst attitudes toward sexual minorities? Comparison of transphobia and homophobia levels in gender dysphoric individuals, the general population and health care providers by Alessandra Daphne Fisher et al. is published in the Journal of Endocrinological Investigation 
In this piece, Alessandra Daphne Fisher et al. works to use comparative analysis techniques to look at the attitudes toward homosexual and transgender patients. They used the Modern Homophobia Scale (MHS) as well as the Attitudes Toward Transgendered Individuals Scale (ATTI) in order to measure attitudes of healthcare workers. They additionally used the Religious Fundamentalism Scale (RFS) as well as the Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC-12) to measure perceived discrimination in the sample population. They argue that their study found evidence of a need for more awareness and acceptance of these minority groups in order to oppose discriminatory tendencies and to improve treatment. They propose improved training for healthcare providers to combat this issue. There is no clear bias in this source.
2018 Homosexual Relations in Skin and Sexually Diseases: Law Perspective by Muji Iswanty et al. is published in the Journal of Law, Policy and Globalization
In this article, Muji Iswanty et al. evaluates the relationship between healthcare providers and LGBT patients as a result of policy and legal decision making in Indonesia. They do this in the context of a changing global social consciousness of homosexuality. They argue that the law has a defining role in the relationship between healthcare professionals and LGBT patients that doesn’t always stem from religious beliefs and actions from the government. In the study evaluated they also found that there was an “increase in Gay homosexual couples, resulting in the emergence of various infectious diseases” (Iswanty et al., 48).
2018 Disclosure of Same-Sex Behaviors to Health-care Providers and Uptake of HIV Testing for Men Who Have Sex With Men: A Systematic Review by Shan Qiao et al. is published in the American Journal of Men’s Health
In this article, Shan Qiao et al. works to conduct a literature review of the findings from 29 different empirical studies and their implications. They are evaluating what factors influence disclosure of sexual identity, as well as whether or not individuals are willing to disclose contact with and possible risk of having HIV. They found that the disclosure rates varied depending on different factors such as subgroups (race, ethnicity, etc.) and study settings. They found that the studies that were conducted in developing countries had less data. The main reasons found for nondisclosure included lack of questions relating to sexuality from healthcare providers, and worries about confidentiality. Due to the variance in the studies that were looked at in this analysis, it makes it hard to come to a concrete conclusion on the data.

2020 Bostock v. Clayton County
Overview: The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (prohibits employment discrimination “because of…sex”) additionally includes discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation.  The Court held that Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against any individual kfor merely being gay or transgender.
Facts of the Case: Gerald Bostock joined a gay softball league and was shortly after fired from his job as a child welfare services coordinator. After facing discrimination from fellow employees, Bostock was fired after Clayton County decided that he had engaged in “conduct unbecoming of its employees”. Bostock then filed a lawsuit claiming that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Question: Does Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination “because of..sex” encompass discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation?
Holding: It is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for an employer to fire an individual employee on the basis of their sexual orientation or identity.
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Evans v. Georgia Regional Hospital (2017) affirmed that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 could be interpreted as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
* They looked at Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it prohibits employment discrimination, and the question pertained to whether or not this extended to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and identity
* The language in the statute unambiguously prohibits the discriminatory practice despite the fact that few in 1964 would have anticipated the Title VII protections to apply to homosexuals
* The Court claimed that it is impossible to consider an individual’s  sexuality without first acknowledging their sex, and that sex has to be a “for for” cause to fire an individual, it cannot be the solitary reason
* Title VII is about protecting individuals against discrimination, not groups
* Clayton County claimed they treated men and women equally 
* The Court argued that it didn’t matter what the original intent of Title VII was or whether legislators in 1964 would agree with the 2020 application, what matters is what the statute actually reads as
* In Justice Alito’s dissent, he argues that there should be more weight applied to textualism and that it should be applied as it was originally intended and that the decision of the Court should better reflect the current values of society
* In Justice Kavanaugh’s dissent, he claims that it is not the duty of the Court to protect LGBTQ+ workers. He argues that since Congress lacked the foresight to include sexual orientation, it is not the Court’s duty to fix it. He wanted the use of the word “sex to be used in an ordinary sense.
* The case is statutory, not constitutional
* They observed the definition of discriminate and the past definition is the same as it was when Title VII was put in place
* They argued that if changing the sex of the claimant leads to a different result, it demonstrates discrimination (i.e. if Sarah is fired for being married to Leila, but wouldn’t have been fired if she were married to Jacob, then it is discrimination).
* They argue to sexual orientation and transgender status are not the key focuses in this case since they are not listed in Title VII, but sex is

2022 Don’t Say Gay Bill is Signed in Florida
        Florida House Bill 1557, otherwise known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation, and gender identity before the 4th grade. It additionally requires such instruction to be age and developmentally appropriate.
2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization 
Overview: The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not Mississippi’s law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks’ gestational age is unconstitutional. It held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overturning Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833. This was decided on three arguments: the Constitution does not mention abortion, the right is not deeply rooted in the nation's history, and it is not an essential component of “ordered liberty”.
Facts of the Case: Mississippi passed the Gestational Age Act in 2018, which prohibited all abortions, with few exceptions, after 15 weeks’ gestational age. Jackson Women’s Health Organization filed a lawsuit which challenged the law and requested an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO). The district court found that the state had not provided evidence that a fetus would be viable at 15 weeks, and Supreme Court precedent prohibited states from banning abortions prior to viability. 
Question: Is Mississippi’s law that banned nearly all abortions after 15 weeks’ gestational age unconstitutional?
Holding: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.
Key Ideas and Information from this case:
* Mississippi Gestational Age Act: except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform or induce an abortion if the fetus has reached 15 or more weeks
* Roe and Casey are overruled, and the Court holds that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion
* Claims that Casey reaffirmed Roe solely on the basis of stare decisis
* Regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures
* Right to an abortion is not upheld historically and it is different than other rights as it aims to destroy potential life instead of protect it
* It was undemocratic, legislators and the votes of people should dictate right to abortion
* Roe had no standing in terms of constitutional text, history, or precedent
* Roe and Casey have had poor effects on legal doctrines
* Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend concrete reliance interests
* Rational-basis review is the appropriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge
* The case for why Roe and Casey should be overturned was tied to 5 factors: nature of error (if viability is the standard, it causes issues because science will always change, Roe therefore wasn’t justified), quality of reasoning, workability (does it work in the lower courts?), disruptive effect (causes issues in other areas of the law) , and the absence of concrete reliance 
* Abortion rights are not protected in the Constitution or by our country’s history
* Roe had ignored constitutional text, history, and precedent
* Casey perpetuated these errors
* Does not deal with contraceptives or same-sex marriage, just with rights that deal with “potential life”
* Constitution is neutral so it should be up to states to decide
* Sotomayor and Breyer, and Kagan are worried the implications of this will cause issues with privacy and will allow government interference in private matters
* In this case, the Due Process Clause protects procedural and substantive rights. 
* Those who are at a disadvantage are those who can’t afford to cross state lines to get abortions in different states
* The dissent argues that legal or factual changes are needed to change precedent, and that neither had happened to warrant the overturning of Roe or Casey

2021 The intersection of racism, discrimination, bias, and homophobia toward African American sexual minority patients with cancer within the health care system by Ronit Elk is published in Cancer
In this article, Ronit Elk works to focus on the theoretical approach of intersectionality in understanding the treatment of cancer and healthcare outcomes in relation to treatment based on identity. Elk argues that the lack of trust in both populations of people of color, as well as the LGBT communities towards our health care system complicate care. Elk urges health care professionals to take the first step towards acknowledging these effects on health outcomes, and to become more aware of these disparities. His main argument is that it is impossible to fix an issue if it is not acknowledged in the first place. 
2024 The Consequences of Homophobia: Analysis of Discriminatory Medical and Legislative Policies and Their Influence on Health Disparities is published by the University of South Dakota as an Honors Thesis written by Kaiden J. Fandel
In this thesis, Kaiden J. Fandel works to trace homophobia as a greater societal issue in order to understand how homophobia impacts medical professional attitudes, healthcare access, and health outcomes. Fandel works to trace the impact of State legislation on the wellbeing of students who identify as being part of the LGBT community. Fandel works to understand the specific impacts on education that negative stigma and homophobia have such as the dehumanization of LGBT students as patients in the medical community. Fandel claims that homophobia starts in education and training courses for teachers. The lack of sexual education and accessible spaces such as GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) clubs in schools are some more specific examples Fandel identifies as issues that need to be addressed. In order to achieve this, Fandel pushes for changes in legislation that don’t block the inclusion of policies that expand knowledge for youth in this area.
