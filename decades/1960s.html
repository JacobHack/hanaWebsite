                    <p class="description">
                        On April 21, 1966 three men walked into the Julius Bar in Greenwich Village where they approached the bartender, told him they were gay, and then asked for a drink. Shortly after their declaration and request, they were denied service. At the time bars that served gay individuals were at risk of having their liquor license removed. Emulating the sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement, the three men from the Mattachine Society staged the sip-in with the goal of bringing awareness, and in order to sue the New York Liquor Authority. The suit resulted in the New York City Commission on Human Rights to declare that gay individuals have the right to be served.                    </p>

                        A result of the persistent police harassment and violence towards trans people, more specifically trans women and drag queens, the Compton Cafeteria Riot took place in August of 1966 after a policeman had harassed a trans woman for cross-dressing. He attempted to arrest her for “female impersonation”. She refused to be arrested and the officer subsequently grabbed her and attempted to put handcuffs on her. Fed up with consistent police harassment, she threw a cup of coffee in his face. This resulted in a riot in the community where chairs and dishes were thrown and police car windows were shattered.

                        Situated in Greenwich Village, the Stonewall Inn was a bar run by the Genovese crime family. A few days before the police raid that sparked the Stonewall Riots, a corrupt officer had tipped off the bar before the police could arrive, allowing them to stash the alcohol and hide other illegal activities. On June 28, 1969 police officers entered the club and arrested 13 people who they found in violation with the state’s gender-appropriate clothing statute. As people were being manhandled in the process the crowd, already tired of police harassment, the crowd began to throw things at the police and a riot ensued.

                        Inspired by the Stonewall riots, in July of 1969 the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was formed in New York City. It sought to fill the gaps that they perceived in the work of groups like the Mattachine Society. They were more forceful and worked to demand their rights. They worked to deconstruct sex roles and to create liberation for oppressed groups. They were particularly interested in developing a new public consciousness surrounding sex and sexuality.                    </p>

                        Similar to the GLF, the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) was formed in New York City in December of 1969 after the Stonewall riots had taken place. It was formed by a group of individuals who had left the GLF and wanted to focus on the liberation of specifically the gay community. It would become the most influential organization pushing for gay liberation in the 1970s.
