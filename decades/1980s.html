                        In 1981 the first cases of AIDS were recorded. In California and New York doctors had begun to see an influx of Kaposi’s Sarcoma in male patients. This article was the first of many that would stigmatize the correlation between gay men and AIDS. In early years of the AIDS crisis, with not much information on how the disease was transmitted it was thought that it was airborne and could be transferred from person to person.                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Gregory M. Herek works to define homophobia as hostile reactions derived from fear. Based on this definition of homophobia, he argues for the development of knowledge about the overall psychology surrounding both positive and negative attitudes towards homosexual individuals. He argues that there are three ways to differentiate attitudes towards homosexual individuals: experiential (allowing past experience to affect current attitudes), defensive (allowing one’s inner fear and anxiety to be taken out on homosexual individuals), and symbolic (having views that are closely tied to a concept of self and one’s social network). He additionally works to find any differences between attitudes toward gay men and lesbians.                    </p>

                        In this article, Carolyn J. Douglas et al. looked at attitudes towards homosexuality in medical practitioners at an urban teaching hospital. They found that respondents who were female were significantly more homophobic than their male counterparts. Additionally, they found that those who had a friend or family member who was part of the LGBT community were less homophobic than those who did not. Close to 10% of the respondents in the study agreed with a provided statement that “homosexuals who contract AIDS are getting what they deserve” (Douglas et al. 1309). Douglas et al. claims that based on these findings, there should be a response from the medical community and that homophobia is higher than otherwise would have been expected in the tested group of health professionals.                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        Ronald Bayer works to evaluate the promises that have been made by the medical community and the government in respect to developments and protection. The AIDS crisis is something that he identifies as being a point of extreme tension between the public and medical health professionals. The AIDS crisis and the CDC’s (and health officials as a whole) reaction to the crisis have emphasized the fears of the public, specifically LGBT patients. He argues that this fear stems from existing hope that the healthcare system and medicine overall will be able to come up with solutions that they had previously made promises of.                    </p>

                        Bowers v. Hardwick
                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not there is a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy. The main argument that was presented was that you cannot do anything that you want in your home just because you want to (murder, etc.). There also was the question of if the government could ban sodomy and then pick out a specific group to enforce it upon. The Court held that there was no constitutional protection for acts of sodomy and that states could outlaw those practices. In this decision, the Court has acted to protect rights not easily identifiable in the constitution only when those rights are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, or when they are deeply rooted in the nation’s history and tradition (which the right to commit sodomy did not meet either standard).
                        Facts of the Case: Michael Hardwick was seen by a police officer while engaging in the act of consensual homosexual sodomy in the bedroom of his home. He was charged with violating a Georgia statute which criminalized sodomy. Hardwick challenged the constitutionality of the statute.

                        In this piece, Gary Remafedi conducted a study on 29 homosexual and bisexual teenagers. They interviewed the participants looking at possible impacts of family, employment, education, relationships, and both physician and mental health on sexuality. They found that a majority of those interviewed had experienced problems at school, and had a history of STDs, running away from home, or conflict with the law. A minority of those interviewed had been sexually assaulted or been involved in prostitution. In the study, those that were younger than 18 years old had higher rates of psychiatric hospitalization, substance abuse, being high school dropouts, and had more conflict with the law than their older counterparts.                     </p>

                        In this source, David Randolph Smith looks to examine 3 issues that have become of interest to those in the field of law and medicine. He evaluates: (1) “significant and developing legal issues related to AIDS in the areas of discrimination, criminal law, tort liability and insurance,” (2) “the constitutionality of recent tort reform laws, particularly under emerging principles of state constitutional law,” and (3) “medical malpractice liability with a focus on trends in the law of informed consent, emotional distress and hospital liability for premature transfer of uninsured patients” (Smith 370). The piece is informative, but in his timeline he reinforces the concept that the law is continuously evolving in relation to LGBT issues and that the AIDS crisis is a particularly special example of a time period in the 80’s where legal reform reacted to social and medical issues.                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        Influenced by the AIDS epidemic, and curious about how attitudes towards homosexuality on a social, political, and economic scale function and interact with one another, Irving Bieber works to understand attitudes towards sexuality over time. He works to evaluate famous individuals such as Freud, as well as events leading up to and including the AIDS crisis. He is specifically looking at a 25 year span of time from 1963-1988 where he stands in history. This time period works with social events such as the Stonewall riots, and Dr. Anonymous’s speech at the APA conference in 1973. This time period is particularly salient and significant when looking at changes in our understanding and attitudes towards homosexuality.                    </p>
