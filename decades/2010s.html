                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Jack Drescher works to evaluate changes in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) over time, starting in 1973. He specifically evaluates how homosexuality as a diagnosis was removed from the DSM-II in 1973 as well as how the GID (Gender Identity Disorder) diagnosis came to be in the DSM-III in 1980. His work is scientific but mimics a historiographical format. He evaluates the past of the DSM in order to recommend future changes for the DSM-V, as well as argues that the APA (American Psychiatric Association) and the DSM have a distinct role in changing and shifting societal attitudes towards the LGBT community.                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Caroline Dorsen works to evaluate the negative impacts of healthcare worker attitudes on the health of LGBT patients through an intensive literature review. She argues that increased knowledge of this can lead to more resources being put towards fixing these attitudes through awareness and training. She focuses more specifically on nurse attitudes towards LGBT patients. She points out that the majority of the studies being looked at are more than a decade old and that they often demonstrate sampling and response biases. This piece is unique since it pertains specifically to nurse attitudes rather than physicians or other healthcare professionals.

Their work is helpful in understanding greater societal attitudes towards homosexual men (that inherently impact the attitudes of medical professionals). It isn't particularly salient in understanding healthcare outcomes, but it is helpful in understanding the changing attitudes in heterosexual males, and how the inclusion of homosexual males into traditionally heterosexual spaces is impacting the groups and how they interact.

                    <p class="description">
                        In this piece, Michele D. Sherman et al. evaluates the intersectionality between the LGBT community, the veteran community, and healthcare providers. They work to argue that staff training is a necessary development to improve treatment for veterans who are in the LGBT community. This work is different from my other sources since it includes a whole community that includes the LGBT community as a subsector, rather than the main focus of treatment. One big limitation to this source is that even though half of the participants worked in mental health in the other professions only 19% were physicians, 16% were psychologists, and 15% were social workers. The goal of this source is to both expand and improve patient care for veterans who are also a part of the LGBT community.                    </p>

                        In this article, Vivek Datta argues that tracking the history of homosexuality in the DSM can show us that changes in disorders takes time, that diagnoses are strongly tied to and influenced by social prejudice, that the idea of illnesses and disorders is a social construct, the way we choose to define disorders has direct social consequences, and that shifts in our overall perceptions of the nature of disorders helps us to better understand social, political, and economic factors better than it helps us understand scientific advancement.

                        Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality by Jack Drescher is published in Behavioral Sciences
                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Jack Drescher focuses on the history of homosexuality as a diagnosis in the DSM (Dianostic and Statistical Manual) tracking its conception in DSM-I to its removal from DSM III. He then looks at the sociocultural aftermath of the 1973 removal of homosexuality as a diagnosis from the DSM. He identifies three categories in which homosexuality falls into: pathology, immaturity, and normal variation. He describes theories of pathology as portraying homosexuality as a sign of a defect, and associate it with being morally bad, and a social evil. He describes theories of immaturity as representing homosexuality as a normal, and natural given step towards the development of heterosexuality which comes when one becomes an adult. Lastly, he addresses the theory of normal variation in which homosexuality is treated as a natural occurrence (like being left handed). Drescher argues that the APA’s revision of the DSM after 1973 was the start of shifts in the national and international health communities as well as the start of a shift away from debates about medicine and psychiatry and redirected towards moral and political conversations. He additionally argues that removing the diagnosis from the DSM moved conversations from being about what causes and what can treat homosexuality and towards the health needs of the LGBT patients themselves.

                        The Supreme Court evaluated two questions. The first concerned whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment required a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex. The second concerned whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment required a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex that was legally licensed and performed in another state. The Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the right to marry for same sex couples as one of the fundamental liberties. They additionally found that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed the right for same sex couples to marry since they have equal protection under the law.                    </p>

                        In this piece, Janice A. Sabin et al. works to look at the implicit and explicit attitudes of healthcare providers towards LGBT individuals. They found that implicit preferences favored heterosexual individuals over those who were LGBT. They found that more specifically, heterosexual nurses had the strongest implicit preference for heterosexual men over gay men. In all groups of the study, explicit preferences were weaker than implicit preferences. They argue that implicit preferences for heterosexual individuals over those in the LGBT community within the heterosexual health care provider population are strong and affect care. They propose that future research needs to focus on how this implicit sexual prejudice affects care.

                        Similar to Daily (2007), Peace Eze et al. works to point out that equity over equality is a better approach, at least from a health and medical treatment standpoint. In this piece, Eze et al. argues that pushing a narrative that homosexual individuals are just as healthy as heterosexual ones ignores parts of the homosexual identity, and that ignoring aspects of the health challenges that come with being a homosexual individual can put a patient’s care at risk. They emphasize that discrimination is not the solution, but that in order to fairly treat the LGBT community, the health risks associated with the differences in their behaviors and cultural practices within the community should be taken into consideration in treatment.

Jabson et al. works to look at how training, policies, and non-discrimination policies correlates to the attitudes of physicians as well as their overall knowledge of LGBT patients. This study had a low response rate, making the sample size small enough that it makes it hard to generalize. Though, this low response rate arguably can be used to demonstrate physician attitudes toward LGBT patients since it reflects physician disregard for and lack of awareness of LGBT patient care issues. They additionally are looking at the effectiveness of the HEI (Healthcare Equality Index) and find that even with implementation, it may not create the positive change that the HEI intended (to improve healthcare treatment for LGBT patients). They acknowledge that physician attitudes are typically a reflection of their socio political environments.

                        In this piece, Alessandra Daphne Fisher et al. works to use comparative analysis techniques to look at the attitudes toward homosexual and transgender patients. They used the Modern Homophobia Scale (MHS) as well as the Attitudes Toward Transgendered Individuals Scale (ATTI) in order to measure attitudes of healthcare workers. They additionally used the Religious Fundamentalism Scale (RFS) as well as the Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC-12) to measure perceived discrimination in the sample population. They argue that their study found evidence of a need for more awareness and acceptance of these minority groups in order to oppose discriminatory tendencies and to improve treatment. They propose improved training for healthcare providers to combat this issue. There is no clear bias in this source.

                        Homosexual Relations in Skin and Sexually Diseases: Law Perspective by Muji Iswanty et al. is published in the Journal of Law, Policy and Globalization

                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Muji Iswanty et al. evaluates the relationship between healthcare providers and LGBT patients as a result of policy and legal decision making in Indonesia. They do this in the context of a changing global social consciousness of homosexuality. They argue that the law has a defining role in the relationship between healthcare professionals and LGBT patients that doesn’t always stem from religious beliefs and actions from the government. In the study evaluated they also found that there was an “increase in Gay homosexual couples, resulting in the emergence of various infectious diseases” (Iswanty et al., 48).

                        Disclosure of Same-Sex Behaviors to Health-care Providers and Uptake of HIV Testing for Men Who Have Sex With Men: A Systematic Review by Shan Qiao et al. is published in the American Journal of Men’s Health
                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Shan Qiao et al. works to conduct a literature review of the findings from 29 different empirical studies and their implications. They are evaluating what factors influence disclosure of sexual identity, as well as whether or not individuals are willing to disclose contact with and possible risk of having HIV. They found that the disclosure rates varied depending on different factors such as subgroups (race, ethnicity, etc.) and study settings. They found that the studies that were conducted in developing countries had less data. The main reasons found for nondisclosure included lack of questions relating to sexuality from healthcare providers, and worries about confidentiality. Due to the variance in the studies that were looked at in this analysis, it makes it hard to come to a concrete conclusion on the data.
