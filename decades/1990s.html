                        Doctor’s attitudes to male homosexuality: A survey is published by Dinesh Bhugra et al. in Sexual and Marital Therapy
                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        In this piece, Dinesh Bhugra et al. works to evaluate the attitudes of psychiatrists and general practitioners towards the LGBT community. What is particular about this study is that it focuses on male homosexual patients rather than female homosexual patients since they claim that they attract more attention and more feelings are demonstrated towards the male population. The limitations of this study are that the sample size was small enough that it cannot be used to create assumptions about the population of psychiatrists and general practitioners as a whole. It also does not work to differentiate the difference between those who had already been trained and were practicing, and those who were still in training. Additionally, the more extreme responses were dulled down in the statistical analysis format.                    </p>

                        In this article, Bradford N. Bartholow et al. evaluated data collected from urban STD clinics from May of 1989 through April of 1990. 1,001 men who were homosexual and bisexual were interviewed to determine the correlation between sexual abuse in adolescence “mental health counseling and hospitalization, psychoactive substance use, depression, suicidal thoughts or actions, social support, sexual identity development, HIV risk behavior…and risk of sexually trasmitted diseases including HIV infection” (Bartholow et al., 745). They found that the data demonstrates a relation between sexual abuse, quality of life, and health risk behavior in homosexual men. They argue that “increased awareness as to the potential outcomes of male sexual abuse is critically important to the design and implementation of medical and psychological services for sexually abused men” (Bartholow et al., 745). The health risks associated with being homosexual can be both physically and mentally damaging and thus better treatment from healthcare providers is necessary.                    </p>

                        The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not Amendment 2 of Colorado’s State Constitution (which forbade the extension of official protections to those who suffer discrimination due to their sexual orientation) violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. It held that Amendment 2 of the Colorado State Constitution violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was not rationally related to its stated purpose. The Amendment had singled out homosexual and bisexual individuals, which had denied them the right to seek and receive specific legal protection from discrimination. The dissent had argued that the majority decision is not Constitutionally grounded and that the Colorado provision did not disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but instead denied them preferential treatment.                    </p>

                        On September 21, 1996 President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The Defense of Marriage Act stated that no state would be required to recognize same-sex marriages that had been performed in other states. DOMA defines marriage as being only between a man and a woman.

                        In this book, Leslie Moran works to investigate law pertaining to homosexuality, more specifically the review of law on homosexuality by the Wolfenden Committee in the 1950’s. Moran defines homosexuality as not only an identity, but also a category. She prompts the audience to evaluate how legal regulation of sexual relations has been affected by historical context and how it is affected by current societal values.                    </p>

                        In this piece, Alan S. Yang first acknowledges that public sentiment towards homosexuality in society has changed drastically in the two decades leading up to the 90’s. This rate of change has not yet been mapped and it has not been seen before in history. He uses 12 issue areas to create a survey to determine public opinion using empirical evidence. The issue areas include the legality of homosexual behavior and the causes of homosexuality.                    </p>

                        In this article, Dion Dennis works to evaluate the ways in which identity-politics has affected the re-medicalization of homosexuals in the 1980’s. He argues that the re-medicalization of homosexuality as well as a reemergence of homophobia in the public sphere is tied to a quarter century of identity politics. He finds that deconstructing and freeing the public from the bio-bureaucratic categories that has created this movement in the 80’s in reaction to the AIDS crisis is something that creates a necessary intervention from the public. He argues that not only the LGBT population, but the population as a whole has to react for something to happen.                    </p>

                        Katherine A. O’Hanlan et al. conducted a wide overview focusing on the societal, psychosocial, and medical consequences of homophobia. In order to understand this, they looked at a variety of sources including peer-reviewed articles, non-peer-reviewed articles, census data, survey reports (unpublished and published), and current newspaper coverage of events. The researchers conclude that regardless of sexual orientation, or political/religious affiliation, physicians should still be required to be held to their duty to provide the highest standard of care to all patients, regardless of individual differences. They acknowledge the power that physicians in particular have in effecting the treatment of particular populations, and urge that physicians not only use their power to create positive outcomes on an individual basis, but also to support legislation that can help to create more accessibility and expand care for the LGBT community.                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        In this book, Robert J. Corber works to evaluate changes in societal attitudes in the gay community towards “coming out” in the 1950’s. He specifically observes how gay men fought back against societal pressure to remain closeted. He uses sources from the time such as novels, plays, and films to better understand attitudes, while also evaluating the national security state, the growth of the suburbs, and postwar consumer culture to better understand organization and political reform coming out of this period. Corber additionally identifies gay male writers from the period such as Tennessee Williams who worked contradictory to the gay community as a whole, declining to represent homosexuality as a subculture, and instead emboldening this experience as a shared experience of oppression.                    </p>

He additionally looked at movements from groups that he deemed to be more sexually disenfranchised such as the elderly and disabled populations. He pays special attention to changes in traditionally held values and how this impacts reactions to the AIDS crisis. He argues that it is important to track these changes in sexual norms and behavior during the 1980’s to track how it impacted the AIDS crisis.                    </p>

                        In this article, Vern L. Bullough argues that the work of Alfred Kinsey was the major factor that changed attitudes surrounding sex and sexuality in the twentieth century. He traces 1890-1940 as a precursor to Kinsey’s work, specifically focusing on the history of sex research. He then describes Kinsey’s major contributions which included challenging prejudice and preconceived notions relating to sex and sexuality, at least in the United States.                    </p>
