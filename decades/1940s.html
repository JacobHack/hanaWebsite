Despite retaining his homosexuality, he now had restrained/inhibited sexual behavior compared to before the electroshock therapy. In the understanding of homosexuality in the 1940’s, the identity was accepted as a natural occurrence, but was something that could be fixed through medical intervention, it was treated similar to alcoholism.

                                            In this article, Clara Thompson works to identify 3 important parts of defining homosexuality: how it is used, how it is defined, and the social stigma surrounding the terminology. She relies on Freudian principles' impact on present psychoanalytic ideas about homosexuality. She argued that homosexuality is a symptom of neurotic structures and development, contrary to popular belief at the time that it was caused by neurosis. In this claim, she urges psychoanalysis experts to examine personality structure in order to better understand the causes of homosexuality, and therefore how to treat it.                                        </p>

                                            Albert Deutsch publishes the journal article The Sex Habits of American Men: Some of the Finds of the Kinsey Report prior to Alfred Kinsey publishing Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. In his article, Deutsch works to assess the ways that the Kinsey report should prompt the public to change and develop the ways that sex and sexuality is viewed. He discusses the possibility of controversy that the release of the report will create in the societal context of the 1940’s. In his arguments, Deutsch presents the information from the Kinsey report using language and assertions that frame the report as absolute truth that should be pushing the public as a whole to accept developments in the ways that sex and sexuality are viewed.

                                            Arguably the most famous published scientific work on homosexuality from the 1940’s, Alfred Kinsey’s Sexual Behavior in the Human Male presents a statistical study focused on creating a sense of the possible range of sexuality. The study, reliant upon interviews, is commonly criticized for its inconsistent samples as well as the unreliable nature of interviews. Throughout the study, Kinsey works to create a scale to determine the range of sexuality, eventually naming the measure: the Kinsey Scale. It organized the categories of sexual orientation from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual. This report and the scale that it produced changed societal norms that reinforced the notion of strict binary categories previously used to define sexual orientation. It was particularly impactful due to the shock it caused in the public sphere in regards to the large percentage of males that had engaged in homosexuality (in some form or another at least once in their lives) reported in the study.
