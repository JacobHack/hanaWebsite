                        In this article, Gregory P. Beehler works to evaluate the perspective of homosexual men on primary health care. They found that gay men tend to experience health care at two different levels: macro (all medicine is homophobic and is functioning on prejudice which affects treatment), and micro (on an individual level where more of a connection is formed for more of a physician-patient relationship that leads to more trust). They argued that in the current climate of the healthcare system, gay men are required to grapple with prejudice and traditional values that makes it harder for them to receive appropriate care. They acknowledge that appropriate care and meaningful and stable relationships can be formed with health care professionals, but that it is not a given thing like it is for heterosexual patients.

                        Similar to Bieber (1988) and Roughton (2002), Dean and Lee work to understand how Freud’s more accepting view of homosexuality as a natural part of human behavior can shape our views on homosexuality going forward. They specifically look at attitudes stemming from the psychoanalysis community and how their negative views towards homosexuality have changed over time. The piece is in the format of a collection of essays, making it easier to read for high school students. The experts they have written in the book work with texts from Freud, Klein, Reich, Lacan, and Laplanche. They use these previous evaluations to better understand attitudes on psychosis, homophobia, AIDS, and more individual/clinical knowledge on pleasure, disgust, etc.                    </p>

                        In this article, Roughton splits up his work into 3 distinct sections: “(1) the process of policy change and the overturning of injustice; (2) the excursion after Freud’s death into analytic bias and extreme pathologizing of homosexuality, the struggle to overcome those distortions, and the lessons to be learned from this history; and (3) the search, in the coming decade, for new understanding of homosexuality and all aspects of sexuality” (Roughton 733). He particularly hones in on the importance of Freud’s concepts and the ability to expand these concepts to be more inclusive and accessible to different populations.                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        The Supreme Court evaluated whether the criminal convictions of John Lawrence and Tyron Garner under the Texas “Homosexual Conduct” law (which criminalized sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples) violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection in regards to laws. The main argument was focused on if criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violated their vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. They held that the Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct violates the Due Process Clause. They found that the Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. It overruled Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186. They held that stare decisis (the belief that courts and judges should uphold precedent) doesn’t make Bowers precedent because of some assumptions such as the belief that contemporary morals and tradition condemn homosexual sodomy are no longer reliable.                    </p>

                        In this piece, Michael Brendan Flanagan works to look at the pathology of homosexual behavior, and considers what makes it a danger to public health. He argues that the movement towards “political correctness” has created a push for accepting homosexuality in the medical community, where it is otherwise evident that “the homosexual act of union, anal copulation, is a dirty, unsanitary act which contravenes basic rules of hygiene. Its abnormality is self-evident” (Flanagan 232-233). He looks at semen antibodies, sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men, gay bowel syndrome, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and pedophilia and related conditions.                    </p>

                        In this article, Kathleen A. Bonvicini and Michael J. Perlin work to create a summary of medical literature that pertains to healthcare with gay and lesbian patients. They work to evaluate common communication barriers. They argue that there are a ton of different strategies that can be applied to create more inclusion and better treatment for lesbian and gay patients in healthcare (as patients). They argue that their proposed strategies will create more effective communication between patients and medical professionals. Some of these strategies include: structuring questions to questions that are aimed towards gaining knowledge of a patient’s sexual orientation and relationship status, as well as to create a safe and welcoming practice environment, and finally to communicate consideration of partners and family relationships.                    </p>

Arts (2003) and the history of AIDS to better understand the implications of medical malpractice suits that are affecting LGBT patients. He more specifically evaluated a specific case that evaluated if “a doctor who misreads an HIV test, telling a patient that it is positive, be held liable for emotional damages caused by the misdiagnosis and subsequent advice” (Hunter 386). Another case he looks at is Williamson v. Waldman (2003).                    </p>

                        In this piece, Michele J. Eliason and Tonda Hughes focus on treatment counselor attitudes in particular. They look at the attitudes of treatment counselors towards LGBT individuals as well as how these attitudes can affect a client’s recovery. They are interested in how differences in locations (and therefore training and ability) changes these attitudes and affects, and if a difference between the two even exists at all. They used urban Chicago and rural Iowa in 2000 as the population samples. They found that Chicago’s counselors were more racially diverse, and more likely to have grown up in an urban setting than the Iowa counselors. This meant that they reported having more contact with the LGBT population. Despite this, they did not have more knowledge or a more positive association with the LGBT population. Both populations were found to have not sufficient knowledge in the area of the LGBT community including legal issues, domestic partnership, internalized homophobia, etc. Nearly half of the counselors, regardless of urban or rural location reported negative or ambivalent attitudes toward the LGBT population                    </p>

                        In this article, Vittorio Lingiardi and Paola Capozzi conduct an analysis of existing psychoanalytic theories on homosexuality, focusing on attitudes towards homosexuality. They conducted this study on the Italian community so it is not particularly applicable to studying the United States, but it is helpful in understanding that these attitudes are not only identifiable in the U.S. and therefore is not a direct reflection of the health care system in the United States. They used a questionnaire as their way of obtaining results. Their pool was only 206 respondents (out of the 600 individuals that they sent the questionnaire to).                    </p>

                        In this piece, Bryan N. Cochran et al. works to investigate treatment providers’ attitudes toward LGBT individuals. They worked with a sample of 46 substance abuse treatment counselors. They found that the counselors who were heterosexual and who had less LGBT friends tended to have more negative biases regarding LGBT individuals. It is notable that biases in this sample were significantly less than in comparison samples. The general argument of this study is similar to the other studies that I will be looking at in the fact that it is looking to prove that current treatment for the LGBT community is not sufficient and therefore should be expanded. The study acknowledges that their findings may be limited due to the substantial proportion of participants who identify themselves as LGBT and who may have more of an interest in LGBT treatment than other counselors may.                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Timothy J. Dailey identifies that Hollywood and the media have been working to bring political and social equality through the use of portraying homosexual individuals as being the same as heterosexual individuals. He finds this to be harmful since the two groups aren’t the same, and medically should not be treated as such. Acknowledging that homosexuality makes you more prone to certain diseases, more specifically STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) makes treatment for the LGBT community more accessible. He argues that gay and lesbians who are engaging in sexual relationships are more at risk for: risky sexual behavior, promiscuity, HPV (Human Papillomavirus), hepatitis, gonorrhea, syphilis, gay bowel syndrome, HIV/AIDS, anal cancer, intimate partner violence, greater risk of suicide, and possible reduced life span. All of these risks are life-threatening and Dailey argues that they need to be treated as such. This piece does not have any clear bias, but is clearly fighting against biases being propagated through the media.                    </p>

                        Psychoanalysis and Male Homosexuality by Kenneth Lewes comes out
                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        In this book, Kenneth Lewes evaluates how male homosexuality has been viewed in the context of historical, cultural, and theoretical works. He works through ideas of homosexuality stemming from Freud to the 1980’s. He demonstrates the ways that compassion and understanding became less important to psychoanalytic clinicians and theorists. He focuses specifically on the limits and opportunities that come with psychoanalysis.                    </p>

                        The Matthew Shepard Act/Hate Crimes Prevention Act is passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama

                    <p class="description">
                        On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed into law the Matthew Shepard Act, otherwise known as the Hate Crimes Prevention Act which expanded federal hate crime protections to include gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity, as well as disability to existing protections. The act was meant to strengthen protections against hate crimes and to help to put federal support towards state and local jurisdictions so that they would better be able to investigate and prosecute hate crimes.                    </p>
