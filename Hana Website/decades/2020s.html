                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (prohibits employment discrimination “because of…sex”) additionally includes discrimination based on an individual’s sexual orientation.  The Court held that Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against any individual kfor merely being gay or transgender.
                        Facts of the Case: Gerald Bostock joined a gay softball league and was shortly after fired from his job as a child welfare services coordinator. After facing discrimination from fellow employees, Bostock was fired after Clayton County decided that he had engaged in “conduct unbecoming of its employees”. Bostock then filed a lawsuit claiming that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, Ronit Elk works to focus on the theoretical approach of intersectionality in understanding the treatment of cancer and healthcare outcomes in relation to treatment based on identity. Elk argues that the lack of trust in both populations of people of color, as well as the LGBT communities towards our health care system complicate care. Elk urges health care professionals to take the first step towards acknowledging these effects on health outcomes, and to become more aware of these disparities. His main argument is that it is impossible to fix an issue if it is not acknowledged in the first place.

                        The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not Mississippi’s law banning nearly all abortions after 15 weeks’ gestational age is unconstitutional. It held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overturning Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833. This was decided on three arguments: the Constitution does not mention abortion, the right is not deeply rooted in the nation's history, and it is not an essential component of “ordered liberty”.

                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        In this thesis, Kaiden J. Fandel works to trace homophobia as a greater societal issue in order to understand how homophobia impacts medical professional attitudes, healthcare access, and health outcomes. Fandel works to trace the impact of State legislation on the wellbeing of students who identify as being part of the LGBT community. Fandel works to understand the specific impacts on education that negative stigma and homophobia have such as the dehumanization of LGBT students as patients in the medical community. Fandel claims that homophobia starts in education and training courses for teachers. The lack of sexual education and accessible spaces such as GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) clubs in schools are some more specific examples Fandel identifies as issues that need to be addressed. In order to achieve this, Fandel pushes for changes in legislation that don’t block the inclusion of policies that expand knowledge for youth in this area.
