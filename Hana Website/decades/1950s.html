                                            A gay rights organization, one of the first of its kind in the United States. They worked to stop police entrapment of gay men, and provided legal advice to those who had been arrested. They saw the government, religion, and psychiatry as main drivers of oppression.

                                        <p class="description">
                                            Strongly influenced by the Red Scare, the Lavender Scare came about out of social fear that was rapidly expanding due to governmental decision making. The Hoey committee, made up of a variety of individuals from medical professionals to law enforcement, created the Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government. This report was created in order to demonstrate the committee’s findings as well as propose recommendations based on their findings. One main finding that they presented was that around 5,000 individuals in the military and civilian workforce were found to be homosexual. They argued that homosexuals should not be employed within the U.S. government. The report used arguments surrounding the emotional instability and moral weakness of homosexuals and pointed to these attributes as main reasons that homosexuals were not to be trusted in governmental positions. It did not include any new policy proposals, but it did ask for harsher enforcement of current policy. This report would eventually lead to President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Executive Order 10450. This report is integral in understanding how social attitudes shape governmental decision making. It shows the way that existing prejudice can be easy to twist in times of great fear.                                        </p>

                                            As a continuation of his work in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), Alfred Kinsey et al. works to evaluate two behavioral characteristics: the frequency of sexual activity in women, and the ways in which women engage in sexual activity. In the study they looked at factors such as age, decade that the individual was born, and religious beliefs. Similar to their previous work, sampling bias and interview methodology made the study an easy target of criticism.

Executive Order 10450 was signed on April 27th of 1953 and essentially banned all homosexuals from working in the federal government. Around 7,000-10,000 federal employees were fired, or had resigned from their positions due to this Executive Order. This Executive Order was seen as an extension of Executive Order 9835 which established the first loyalty program in the federal government. Signed by President Harry S. Truman on March 21st of 1947, it was intended to remove communist influences from the federal government.

                                            As a follow up to his previous study, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female by Alfred Kinsey et al. worked to expand on the findings from Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. It evaluated the frequency and ways in which women engage in sexual activity. They specifically looked at factors such as age, what decade the individual was born, and religious beliefs. Similar to their first work, criticisms were presented on the sampling bias and interview methodology used in the study. This work had a similar effect on the public due to its push back against traditional concepts and prejudice in society.

                                        <p class="description">
                                            The APA in 1956 strongly believed that homosexuality was a mental illness. This was backed by studies and research done on individuals who were already experiencing mental illness in prisons and reform schools. Evelyn worked to expand on this work, researching gay men who had never been in therapy, and who had no track record with violating the law. She studied 30 gay men and 30 straight men as a control group. She had utilized a panel of experts who ran an identification test in a double-blind experiment where only Evelyn knew what participants were gay and what they were testing for. She found that the experts were unable to differentiate the gay men from the straight men. The main criticism that she faced at the APA convention was that her sample size had been insufficient. Based on her study, Evelyn argued that homosexuality was not pathological, and could not be classified as a mental illness.

                                            In this article, Karl Bowman and Bernice Engle use phraseology in order to aid in understanding the feelings of prejudice and tradition that are associated with sodomy and other related acts. They focus on this more specifically in a legal setting. They argue that legal evaluation of the degree of guilt that is determined to be aligned with and assigned to each sex crime is commonly driven by emotion. They additionally argue that current laws on sex crimes leave opportunity for the targeting of specific individuals and groups. They argue that some laws amplify the danger of gossip, specifically pertaining to possible homosexuality of individuals when it puts an individual’s career and other things that make up a life at risk. Law has a significant role in shaping public opinion.

The group published ONE: The Homosexual Magazine starting in 1953 and was shortly after harassed by the U.S. Post Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After the October 1954 issue was released, Los Angeles Postmaster Otto Olesen declared the magazine unmailable under the Comstock Act of 1873. 
                                            Question: Does the publication of ONE: The Homosexual Magazine violate obscenity laws?
                                            Holding: They ruled that the publication did not violate obscenity laws and affirmed the free speech rights of gays and lesbians

                                        <p class="description">
                                            In this piece, Walter O. Weyrauch is interested in evaluating the thoughts of legally trained individuals on the Kinsey reports. He works with attorneys more specifically in an effort to contrast expert opinion with public reactions. He first identifies that public reactions were primarily negative and tended to be strongly associated with prejudice. He argues that legislative changes come from the reports’ influence on societal attitudes, and that attorneys should prepare themselves for these influences. He additionally prompts future attorneys to prepare themselves for these changes and influences by making themselves familiar with the research done in the Kinsey reports. He focuses on the symbiotic relationship between legal decision making and public opinion and predicts that both will be affected by the findings of the Kinsey reports.                                        </p>
