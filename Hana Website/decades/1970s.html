                        The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit evaluated whether or not a physician has a duty to disclose the risk associated with surgery. The Court held that a physician has a legal responsibility to disclose the potential risks of a medical procedure to a patient before allowing a patient to make an informed decision about whether to undergo treatment. This case outlined a right of an adult to make decisions regarding their body, the reasonable patient standard (a doctor has to disclose risks that a reasonable person in the patient’s scenario would consider to be important in making a decision regarding their medical care), and jury determination (jury gets to decide whether a doctor has provided sufficient information to the patient).

                        Dr. Anonymous, an alias used for John Fryer, gave a speech at the APA’s annual meeting in 1972 where he revealed that he was a homosexual. He did so while wearing a disguise to protect his identity. He gave the speech with the intention of describing his experience as a homosexual in the psychiatric community. In his speech he urged his fellow psychiatrists who were homosexual like himself, to work to change the attitudes of those around them. Fryer explained the struggle of existing in the psychiatric community as a homosexual in relation to societal opinion and traditional values. He prompted the APA to remove the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness from the DSM. His speech would be a key factor in the APA’s decision to remove the classification in 1973.                    </p>

                        “Coming Out” was performed for the first time on June 16, 1972 in a firehouse that was rented out by the GAA. The play displayed gay and lesbian lives and their liberation. Jonathan Ned Katz utilized historical materials such as newspapers, personal interviews, etc. in order to create a historically accurate portrayal of gay life. The play helped to amplify consciousness within the community and helped to establish a network of gay and lesbian individuals for things like the studying of history and group therapy sessions.                    </p>

                        The Supreme Court evaluated whether or not the Constitution recognizes a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. It held that the Right to Privacy is in the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment which would protect a pregnant woman’s choice whether or not to have an abortion.
                        Facts of the Case: Jane Roe (an alias used to protect the plaintiff’s identity), filed a lawsuit against Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County, Texas, challenging a Texas law that had made abortion illegal except to save a woman’s life. The case argued that the state law was unconstitutional due to its vague nature and its infringement of her personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

Through this case four laws that had previously pertained to loitering, cross-dressing, renting out rooms, and policies that enabled police entrapment through solicitation were repealed.                    </p>

                        Homosexuality and the medical profession: a behaviorist’s view by John Bancroft is published in the Journal of Medical Ethics
                    </h5>
                    <p class="description">
                        In this article, John Bancroft argued that homosexuality is not a disease, and does not make an individual a sinner. He identified that physicians have a key role in influencing society’s attitudes towards homosexuals and that with this in mind, doctors should treat these individuals with understanding. He comes to a few different conclusions. The first is that homosexuality is an interpersonal sexual relationship that is similar to heterosexuality, and should be treated as such. The second is that these individuals do seek professional help and should have that resource available to them if they are looking for it. The third is that some individuals need help from professionals to help with their sexual desires that may otherwise get them in trouble with the law. The fourth is that no matter what manner it is used, the law cannot replace or be used in tandem with medical treatment to “treat” homosexuality.                    </p>

In response to this ordinance, Anita Bryant (a singer) claimed that the ordinance discriminated against her individual right to teach her children about biblical morality. The “Save Our Children” coalition became the first organized opposition to the gay rights movement.                    </p>
